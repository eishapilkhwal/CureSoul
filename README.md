# Introduction
  
    The silent killer that takes lives without warning, punishment, or any sympathy; DEPRESSION. Depression is defined as a mental illness inducing a severe and staunch feeling of sadness. It is one of the leading causes of suicide in whole world, which has become the second leading cause of death among young Indians too. 
    
    Are you depressed? While most people would shy away from admitting it, many others remain unaware of this condition. People are not interested in sharing their problems with others. They don’t consult a counsellor, and even hesitate talking about depression.

    ‘CureSoul’ will be a Feeling and Healing website for those people who are suffering from depression.  This website consists of an extensive range of music, quotations and poetry covering all aspects of psychology, neuroscience, psychiatry and mental health. 

    To simulate the process, we have developed a simple website named CureSoul using Python, MySQL.
    -    The site uses a tabbed interface for each subject featuring music, quotations and poetry.
    -  	More specifically, this website will allow the user to calculate his depression level with the help of Beck Inventory Test and in accordance to which a quote or poetry or music will be recommended (predicted). 

    To explore the website the user has to first SignUp to the website and then attempt the test at a specific time interval, then the depression level of an individual will be displayed accordingly.
