              <p style="text-align: justify;">Depression is a serious condition that negatively affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves.

              </button>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Depression can be a result of a primary psychiatric condition, or it can be secondary to a medical condition. Depression may be caused by use of certain substances, such as alcohol.
              Some of the medical conditions which can cause depression, are hypothyroidism, certain types of cancer such as pancreatic cancer, Parkinson's disease, and others.</p>

                  Experiencing sadness at one time or another is part of the normal human experience. However, depression is more than the occasional sadness that people experience. When an individual suffers from depression, the sadness tends to be more pervasive or long lasting, and can be accompanied by one or more of the following: decreased interest in pleasurable activities, feelings of hopelessness, low self-worth, excessive guilt, decrease in energy, concentration difficulties, appetite changes, sleep difficulty or excessive sleep, headaches, body aches and pains, and/or thoughts of suicide.

              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  Mental health and physical health are closely inter-related. Depression is linked with changes in the brain. Additionally, depression can increase risk for medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, migraine (NIMH, Steffan et al 2020). Chronic depression can also increase the risk of obesity.
                  Studies show that major depressive disorder may increase risk for cardiovascular disease (Van der Kooy et al 2007). On the other hand, depression may emerge after a myocardial infarction, as a first episode or as a recurrent one (Spijkerman et al 2005).<br> Similarly, studies show that depression may increase risk for diabetes, and diabetes may increase the risk of depression (Mezuk et al 2008, Katon 2011, Oladeji and Gureje 2013). Depressive disorders in people who have diabetes, can lower adherence to diabetes treatment, and can increase the likelihood of "poor glycemic control" and complications from diabetes (Oladeji and Gureje 2013).

                  There are effective treatments for depression which have been established through research; many treatments for depression have been around for years. Many people ignore signs of depression despite experiencing significant suffering. This may be due to stigma, lack of awareness, and/or barriers to accessing care. Untreated depression confers several risks. Discussing your concerns about depression with your doctor can often be the first step in getting professional help.

                  Untreated depression can increase risk of depressive episodes becoming more frequent, prolonged and/or severe over time and increase risk of suicide. It can significantly interfere with one's functioning at work, school, and/or in interpersonal relationships. Depression can also increase risk of alcohol and/or substance use disorders. Additionally, depression can worsen the course and outcome of chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and others.

                  Psychotherapy and medications are the most commonly used treatments for depressive disorders. For mild to moderate depression, psychotherapy is generally thought to be the first line treatment. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of medications and psychotherapy is often considered. For severe depression that has not responded to multiple trials of medications and psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may be some of the treatment options. The type of treatment hat is suitable for an individual depends on an individual's specific clinical situation.
